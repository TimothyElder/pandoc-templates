               Introduction, author R. Michael Furr centers his presentation
               around a conceptual understanding of psychometric core issues,
               such as scales, reliability, and validity. Focusing on purpose
               rather than procedure and the ``why'' rather than the ``how
               to,'' this accessible book uses a wide variety of examples from
               behavioral science research so readers can see the importance of
               psychometric fundamentals in research. By emphasizing concepts,
               logic, and practical applications over mathematical proofs, this
               book gives students an appreciation of how measurement problems
               can be addressed and why it is important to address them. The
               book offers readers the most contemporary views of topics in
               psychometrics available in the nontechnical psychometric
               literature.",

                   passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top
                   10\% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model

                   opinion prediction -- missing data imputation, retrodiction,
                   and zero-shot prediction. We present a new methodological
                   framework that incorporates neural embeddings of survey
                   questions, individual beliefs, and temporal contexts to
                   personalize LLMs in opinion prediction. Among 3,110
                   binarized opinions from 68,846 Americans in the General
                   Social Survey from 1972 to 2021, our best models based on
                   Alpaca-7b excels in missing data imputation (AUC = 0.87 for
                   personal opinion prediction and $\rho$ = 0.99 for public
                   opinion prediction) and retrodiction (AUC = 0.86, $\rho$ =
                   0.98). These remarkable prediction capabilities allow us to
                   fill in missing trends with high confidence and pinpoint
                   when public attitudes changed, such as the rising support
                   for same-sex marriage. However, the models show limited
                   performance in a zero-shot prediction task (AUC = 0.73,
                   $\rho$ = 0.67), highlighting challenges presented by LLMs
                   without human responses. Further, we find that the best
                   models' accuracy is lower for individuals with low

                   methods for analyzing protein Transformer models through the
                   lens of attention. We show that attention: (1) captures the

                   the traditional survey-based tools to measure it are

                   models -- language models adapted to online news, TV

                   opinions of subpopulations that have consumed a set of
                   media. To validate this method, we use as ground truth the
                   opinions expressed in U.S. nationally representative surveys
                   on COVID-19 and consumer confidence. Our studies indicate
                   that this approach is (1) predictive of human judgements

                   phrasing and channels of media exposure, (2) more accurate

               States has become dramatically polarized along political lines,
               empirical support for such a pattern is surprisingly elusive.
               Reporting little evidence of mass polarization, previous studies
               assume polarization is evidenced via the amplification of
               existing political alignments. This article considers a
               different pathway: polarization occurring via social, cultural,
               and political alignments coming to encompass an increasingly
               diverse array of opinions and attitudes. The study uses 44 years
               of data from the General Social Survey representing opinions and
               attitudes across a wide array of domains as elements in an
               evolving belief network. Analyses of this network produce
               evidence that mass polarization has increased via a process of
               belief consolidation, entailing the collapse of previously
               cross-cutting alignments, thus creating increasingly broad and
               encompassing clusters organized around cohesive packages of
               beliefs. Further, the increasing salience of political ideology
               and partisanship only partly explains this trend. The structure

                   typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still
                   requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or
                   tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can
                   generally perform a new language task from only a few
                   examples or from simple instructions - something which
                   current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we
                   show that scaling up language models greatly improves

                   competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning

                   language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than
                   any previous non-sparse language model, and test its
                   performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
                   applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with
                   tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text
                   interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong
                   performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
                   question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several
                   tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain
                   adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word
                   in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same
                   time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot
                   learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where
                   GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on
                   large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate

              conceptual similarity judgments are reliable and are related to

              protection are dramatically increasing. The emerging paradigm of
              federated learning efficiently builds machine learning models
              while allowing the private data to be kept at local devices. The

               (1930--2009) to examine how education-relevant gender
               stereotypes changed as women's educational attainment caught up
               with and eventually surpassed men's. This case presents a rare
               opportunity to observe how cultural components of the gender
               system transform alongside the reversal of an important pattern
               of stratification. We track six stereotypes that prior work
               linked to academic outcomes. Our results suggest that
               stereotypes most closely tied to the core stereotypical
               distinction between women as communal and men as agentic
               remained unchanged. The other stereotypes we tracked, however,
               became increasingly gender polarized: as school and studying
               gained feminine associations, intelligence and unintelligence
               gained masculine ones. Unexpectedly, we observe that trends in
               the gender associations of intelligence and studying are
               near-perfect mirror opposites, suggesting an interrelationship.
               We use these observations to further elaborate contemporary
               theoretical accounts of the gender system, arguing that this
               system persists partly because stereotypes shift to reinterpret

               superdelegates. This concern threw into relief the prevailing
               notion that---such unusually competitive cases
               notwithstanding---people, rather than parties, should and do
               control presidential nominations. But for the past several
               decades, The Party Decides shows, unelected insiders in both
               major parties have effectively selected candidates long before
               citizens reached the ballot box. Tracing the evolution of
               presidential nominations since the 1790s, this volume
               demonstrates how party insiders have sought since America's
               founding to control nominations as a means of getting what they
               want from government. Contrary to the common view that the party
               reforms of the 1970s gave voters more power, the authors contend
               that the most consequential contests remain the candidates'
               fights for prominent endorsements and the support of various

               participants). These databases, which are much larger and more
               heterogeneous than those used in previous meta-analyses, confirm
               that significant ideological asymmetries exist with respect to
               dogmatism, cognitive/perceptual rigidity, personal needs for
               order/structure/closure, integrative complexity, tolerance of
               ambiguity/uncertainty, need for cognition, cognitive reflection,
               self-deception, and subjective perceptions of threat. Exposure
               to objectively threatening circumstances---such as terrorist
               attacks, governmental warnings, and shifts in racial
               demography---contribute to modest ``conservative shifts'' in
               public opinion. There are also ideological asymmetries in
               relational motivation, including the desire to share reality,
               perceptions of within-group consensus, collective self-efficacy,
               homogeneity of social networks, and the tendency to trust the
               government more when one's own political party is in power.
               Although some object to the very notion that there are
               meaningful psychological differences between leftists and
               rightists, the identification of ``elective affinities'' between
               cognitive-motivational processes and contents of specific belief
               systems is essential to the study of political psychology.
               Political psychologists may contribute to the development of a
               good society not by downplaying ideological differences or
               advocating ``Swiss-style neutrality'' when it comes to human
               values, but by investigating such phenomena critically,
               even---or perhaps especially---when there is pressure in society
               to view them uncritically.",

  abstract  = "With employers offering free flu shots and pharmacies expanding
               into one-stop shops to prevent everything from shingles to
               tetanus, vaccines are ubiquitous in contemporary life. The past
               fifty years have witnessed an enormous upsurge in vaccines and
               immunization in the United States: American children now receive
               more vaccines than any previous generation, and laws requiring
               their immunization against a litany of diseases are standard.
               Yet, while vaccination rates have soared and cases of
               preventable infections have plummeted, an increasingly vocal
               cross section of Americans have questioned the safety and
               necessity of vaccines. In Vaccine Nation , Elena Conis explores
               this complicated history and its consequences for personal and
               public health. Vaccine Nation opens in the 1960s, when
               government scientists---triumphant following successes combating
               polio and smallpox---considered how the country might deploy new
               vaccines against what they called the ``milder'' diseases,
               including measles, mumps, and rubella. In the years that
               followed, Conis reveals, vaccines fundamentally changed how
               medical professionals, policy administrators, and ordinary
               Americans came to perceive the diseases they were designed to
               prevent. She brings this history up to the present with an
               insightful look at the past decade's controversy over the
               implementation of the Gardasil vaccine for HPV, which sparked
               extensive debate because of its focus on adolescent girls and
               young women. Through this and other examples, Conis demonstrates
               how the acceptance of vaccines and vaccination policies has been
               as contingent on political and social concerns as on scientific
               findings. By setting the complex story of American vaccination
               within the country's broader history, Vaccine Nation goes beyond
               the simple story of the triumph of science over disease and
               provides a new and perceptive account of the role of politics
               and social forces in medicine.",

  abstract = "Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the
              three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid
              sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the
              structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however,
              protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally.
              Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging
              genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid
              residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous
              sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3.
              Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate
              predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which
              convey more information about the structure than contact
              predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of
              mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein.
              We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple
              gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex
              sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold,
              achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous
              sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure
              Prediction5 (CASP13)-a blind assessment of the state of the
              field-AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template
              modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free
              modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used
              sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only
              14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance
              in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased
              accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of
              proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for
              homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.",

               everything, from terrorism and national security, to taxes and
               government spending, to immigration and gay marriage. Well,
               American elites disagree fiercely. But average Americans do not.
               This, at least, was the position staked out by Philip Converse
               in his famous essay on belief systems, which drew on surveys
               carried out during the Eisenhower Era to conclude that most
               Americans were innocent of ideology. In Neither Liberal nor

               ideological innocence applies nearly as well to the current

               conservatives are found in impressive numbers only among those
               who are deeply engaged in political life. The ideological
               battles between American political elites show up as scattered

               whom to elect president; whether affirmative action is good or
               bad? Kinder and Kalmoe offer a persuasive group-centered answer.

               proven to be challenging because precise measurement requires a

               explain how people acquire political information from elites and
               the mass media and convert it into political preferences. Using
               numerous specific examples, Zaller applies this theory to the
               dynamics of public opinion on a broad range of subjects,
               including domestic and foreign policy, trust in government,
               racial equality, and presidential approval, as well as voting
               behaviour in U.S. House, Senate, and presidential elections. The
               thoery is constructed from four basic premises. The first is
               that individuals differ substantially in their attention to
               politics and therefore in their exposure to elite sources of
               political information. The second is that people react
               critically to political communication only to the extent that
               they are knowledgeable about political affairs. The third is
               that people rarely have fixed attitudes on specific issues;
               rather, they construct 'preference statements' on the fly as
               they confront each issue raised. The fourth is that, in
               constructing these statements, people make the greatest use of
               ideas that are, for various reasons, the most immediately
               salient to them. Zaller emphasizes the role of political elites
               in establishing the terms of political discourse in the mass
               media and the powerful effect of this framing of issues on the

                   better at following a user's intent. For example, large
                   language models can generate outputs that are untruthful,
                   toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words,
                   these models are not aligned with their users. In this
                   paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with
                   user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with
                   human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written
                   prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we
                   collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired
                   model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using
                   supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings
                   of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this
                   supervised model using reinforcement learning from human
                   feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human
                   evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the
                   1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs
                   from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters.
                   Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in
                   truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while
                   having minimal performance regressions on public NLP
                   datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple
                   mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human
                   feedback is a promising direction for aligning language
                   models with human intent.",

               Axelrod has always been a believer. Whether as a young
               journalist investigating city corruption, a campaign consultant
               guiding underdog candidates against entrenched orthodoxy, or as
               senior adviser to the president during one of the worst crises
               in American history, Axelrod held fast to his faith in the power
               of stories to unite diverse communities and ignite
               transformative political change. Now this legendary strategist,
               the mastermind behind Barack Obama's historic election
               campaigns, shares a wealth of stories from his forty-year
               journey through the inner workings of American democracy.
               Believer is the tale of a political life well lived, of a man
               who never gave up on the deepest promises our country has to
               offer.Believer reveals the roots of Axelrod's devotion to
               politics and his faith in democratic change. As a child of the
               '60s in New York City, Axelrod worked his first campaigns during
               a tumultuous decade that began with soaring optimism and ended
               in violence and chaos. As a young newspaperman in Chicago during
               the 1970s and '80s, Axelrod witnessed another world transformed
               when he reported on the dissolution of the last of the big city
               political machines---Richard Daley, Dan Rostenkowski, and Harold
               Washington---along with the emergence of a dynamic black
               independent movement that ultimately made Obama's ascent
               possible.After cutting his teeth in the rollicking world of
               Chicago journalism, Axelrod switched careers to become a
               political strategist. His unorthodox tactics during his first
               campaign helped him get Paul Simon unexpectedly elected to the
               Senate, and soon Axelrod's counsel was sought by the greatest
               lights of the Democratic Party. Working for path breakers like
               Hillary Clinton, Deval Patrick, and Rahm Emanuel---and morally
               conflicted characters like Rod Blagojevich and John
               Edwards---Axelrod, for better and worse, redefined the
               techniques by which modern political campaigns are run.The heart
               of Believer is Axelrod's twenty-year friendship with Barack
               Obama, a warm partnership that inspired both men even as it
               propelled each to great heights. Taking a chance on an unlikely
               candidate for the U.S. Senate, Axelrod ultimately collaborated
               closely with Obama on his political campaigns, and served as the
               invaluable strategist who contributed to the tremendous
               victories of 2008 and 2012. Switching careers again, Axelrod
               served as senior adviser to the president during one of the most
               challenging periods in national history: working at Obama's side
               as he battled an economic disaster; navigated America through
               two wars; and fought to reform health care, the financial
               sector, and our gridlocked political institutions. In Believer,
               Axelrod offers a deeper and richer profile of this extraordinary
               figure---who in just four years vaulted from the Illinois State
               Senate to the Oval Office---from the perspective of one who was
               at his side every step of the way.Spanning forty years that
               include corruption and transformation, turmoil and progress,
               Believer takes readers behind the closed doors of politics even
               as it offers a thrilling call to democratic action. Axelrod's
               Believer is a powerful and inspiring memoir enlivened by the
               charm and candor of one of the greatest political strategists in
               recent American history.DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, author of The

                   can be studied as effective proxies for specific human
                   sub-populations in social science research. Practical and
                   research applications of artificial intelligence tools have
                   sometimes been limited by problematic biases (such as racism
                   or sexism), which are often treated as uniform properties of
                   the models. We show that the ``algorithmic bias'' within one
                   such tool -- the GPT-3 language model -- is instead both
                   fine-grained and demographically correlated, meaning that
                   proper conditioning will cause it to accurately emulate
                   response distributions from a wide variety of human
                   subgroups. We term this property ``algorithmic fidelity''
                   and explore its extent in GPT-3. We create ``silicon
                   samples'' by conditioning the model on thousands of
                   socio-demographic backstories from real human participants
                   in multiple large surveys conducted in the United States. We
                   then compare the silicon and human samples to demonstrate
                   that the information contained in GPT-3 goes far beyond
                   surface similarity. It is nuanced, multifaceted, and
                   reflects the complex interplay between ideas, attitudes, and
                   socio-cultural context that characterize human attitudes. We
                   suggest that language models with sufficient algorithmic
                   fidelity thus constitute a novel and powerful tool to
                   advance understanding of humans and society across a variety

               Transformers are not well understood and remain mostly an
               intuition. In this paper, we suggest that training Transformers
               on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to
               gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing
               a simple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data
               transformations induced by 1) a single linear self-attention
               layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a regression loss.
               Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when
               training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression
               tasks either the models learned by GD and Transformers show
               great similarity or, remarkably, the weights found by
               optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained
               Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by
               gradient descent in their forward pass. This allows us, at least
               in the domain of regression problems, to mechanistically
               understand the inner workings of in-context learning in
               optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore
               identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain
               gradient descent by learning an iterative curvature correction
               and learn linear models on deep data representations to solve
               non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss intriguing
               parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context
               learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show
               how it could be understood as a specific case of in-context
               learning by gradient descent learning within Transformers.",

               is currently limited to recruiting small groups of people.
               Unfortunately, many challenges do not arise until a system is
               populated at a larger scale. Can a designer understand how a
               social system might behave when populated, and make adjustments
               to the design before the system falls prey to such challenges?
               We introduce social simulacra, a prototyping technique that
               generates a breadth of realistic social interactions that may
               emerge when a social computing system is populated. Social
               simulacra take as input the designer's description of a
               community's design---goal, rules, and member personas---and
               produce as output an instance of that design with simulated
               behavior, including posts, replies, and anti-social behaviors.
               We demonstrate that social simulacra shift the behaviors that
               they generate appropriately in response to design changes, and
               that they enable exploration of ``what if?'' scenarios where
               community members or moderators intervene. To power social
               simulacra, we contribute techniques for prompting a large
               language model to generate thousands of distinct community
               members and their social interactions with each other; these
               techniques are enabled by the observation that large language
               models' training data already includes a wide variety of
               positive and negative behavior on social media platforms. In
               evaluations, we show that participants are often unable to
               distinguish social simulacra from actual community behavior and
               that social computing designers successfully refine their social
               computing designs when using social simulacra.",

               definitive work on American public opinion for some time to
               come. Drawing on an enormous body of public opinion data,
               Benjamin I. Page and Robert Y. Shapiro provide the richest
               available portrait of the political views of Americans, from the
               1930's to 1990. They not only cover all types of domestic and
               foreign policy issues, but also consider how opinions vary by
               age, gender, race, region, and the like. The authors
               unequivocally demonstrate that, notwithstanding fluctuations in
               the opinions of individuals, collective public opinion is
               remarkably coherent: it reflects a stable system of values
               shared by the majority of Americans and it responds sensitively
               to new events, arguments, and information reported in the mass
               media. While documenting some alarming case of manipulation,
               Page and Shapiro solidly establish the soundness and value of
               collective political opinion. The Rational Public provides a
               wealth of information about what we as a nation have wanted from
               government, how we have changed our minds over the years, and
               why. For anyone interested in the short- and long-term trends in
               Americans' policy preferences, or eager to learn what Americans
               have thought about issues ranging from racial equality to the MX
               missile, welfare to abortion, this book offers by far the most
               sophisticated and detailed treatment available.",

               aspects of vaccination in the United States tells the story of
               how vaccination became a widely accepted public health measure
               over the course of the twentieth century. One hundred years ago,
               just a handful of vaccines existed, and only one, for smallpox,
               was widely used. Today more than two dozen vaccines are in use,
               fourteen of which are universally recommended for children.
               State of Immunity examines the strategies that health officials
               have used---ranging from advertising and public relations
               campaigns to laws requiring children to be immunized before they
               can attend school---to gain public acceptance of vaccines. Like
               any medical intervention, vaccination carries a small risk of
               adverse reactions. But unlike other procedures, it is performed
               on healthy people, most commonly children, and has been mandated
               by law. Vaccination thus poses unique ethical, political, and
               legal questions. James Colgrove considers how individual liberty
               should be balanced against the need to protect the common
               welfare, how experts should act in the face of incomplete or
               inconsistent scientific information, and how the public should
               be involved in these decisions. A well-researched, intelligent,
               and balanced look at a timely topic, this book explores these

               ethnographic techniques to study the day-to-day practices of
               strategy making in one firm, I examine the ways actors attempted
               to transform their own cognitive frames of a situation into
               predominant frames through a series of interactions. Frames are
               the means by which managers make sense of ambiguous information
               from their environments. Actors each had cognitive frames about
               the direction the market was taking and about what kinds of
               solutions would be appropriate. Where frames about a strategic
               choice were not congruent, actors engaged in highly political
               framing practices to make their frames resonate and to mobilize
               action in their favor. Those actors who most skillfully engaged
               in these practices shaped the frame that prevailed in the
               organization. This framing perspective suggests that frames are
               not only instrumental tools for the ex post justification of
               actions taken through power, but rather are an ex ante part of
               the political process that produces decisions. Uncertainty opens
               up the possibility for new actors to gain power, and contesting
               frames is a way of changing the power structures in the
               organization. A principal contribution of the framing contests
               model is to locate a middle ground between cognitive and
               political models of strategy making, one in which frames are
               both constraints and resources and outcomes can be shaped by

              extensive empirical research had shown that wording effects
              negatively impact latent dimensionality estimates, there was
              scarce systematic research assessing the problem, and no
              validated solutions had been offered. The procedure developed
              consisted in subtracting the wording effects variance from the
              sample correlation matrix and then estimating the substantive
              dimensionality on the residual correlation matrix. This was
              achieved by estimating a random intercept factor with unit
              loadings for all the regular and unrecoded reversed items. The
              accuracy of the procedure was evaluated through a broad
              simulation study that manipulated six relevant variables and
              employed the exploratory graph analysis (EGA) and parallel

                   demonstrate how the temporal dynamics of the embedding can
                   be leveraged to quantify changes in stereotypes and
                   attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and
                   21st centuries in the United States. We integrate word
                   embeddings trained on 100 years of text data with the U.S.
                   Census to show that changes in the embedding track closely
                   with demographic and occupation shifts over time. The
                   embedding captures global social shifts -- e.g., the women's
                   movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the U.S --
                   and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations
                   became more closely associated with certain populations over
                   time. Our framework for temporal analysis of word embedding
                   opens up a powerful new intersection between machine
                   learning and quantitative social science.",

               remains unclear if individuals have coherent attitude systems at
               all?and, if they do, what produces attitude constraint. I argue
               and show that groups can endogenously produce attitude
               constraint via cognitive authorities. Within groups, cognitive
               authorities explicitly link attitudes and generate feelings of

               tensions when attitudes and sentiment relations are misaligned
               (i.e., balance dynamics), and (2) social influence processes
               leading to attitude changes that are concordant with the group?s

               from these systems, collaborate with them, or engage with them
               as partners for an extended duration. In order to develop
               human-oriented AI systems, the problem of predicting human
               actions---as opposed to predicting optimal actions---has
               received considerable attention. Existing work has focused on
               capturing human behavior in an aggregate sense, which
               potentially limits the benefit any particular individual could
               gain from interaction with these systems. We extend this line of
               work by developing highly accurate predictive models of
               individual human behavior in chess. Chess is a rich domain for
               exploring human-AI interaction because it combines a unique set
               of properties: AI systems achieved superhuman performance many
               years ago, and yet humans still interact with them closely, both
               as opponents and as preparation tools, and there is an enormous

              However in the USA, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has
              been politically polarized. The objective of this study is to
              investigate the association between political partisanship and
              COVID-19 deaths rates in the USA. METHODS: This study used
              longitudinal county-level panel data, segmented into 10 30-day
              time periods, consisting of all counties in the USA, from 22
              January 2020 to 5 December 2020. The outcome measure is the total
              number of COVID-19 deaths per 30-day period. The key explanatory
              variable is county political partisanship, dichotomized as
              Democratic or Republican. The analysis used a ZINB regression.
              RESULTS: When compared with Republican counties, COVID-19 death
              rates in Democratic counties were significantly higher (IRRs
              ranged from 2.0 to 18.3, P < 0.001) in Time 1-Time 5, but in Time
              9-Time10, were significantly lower (IRRs ranged from 0.43 to
              0.69, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The reversed trend in COVID-19
              death rates between Democratic and Republican counties was
              influenced by the political polarized response to the pandemic.
              The findings support the necessity of evidence-based public

               the post popularity? This paper develops a method to estimate
               such causal effects from observational text data, adjusting for
               confounding features of the text such as the subject or writing
               quality. We assume that the text suffices for causal adjustment
               but that, in practice, it is prohibitively high-dimensional. To
               address this challenge, we develop causally sufficient
               embeddings, low- dimensional document representations that
               preserve sufficient information for causal identification and
               allow for efficient estimation of causal effects. Causally
               sufficient embeddings combine two ideas. The first is supervised
               dimensionality reduction: causal adjustment requires only the
               aspects of text that are predictive of both the treatment and
               outcome. The second is efficient language modeling:
               representations of text are designed to dispose of
               linguistically irrelevant information, and this information is
               also causally irrelevant. Our method adapts language models
               (specifically, word embeddings and topic models) to learn
               document embeddings that are able to predict both treatment and
               outcome. We study causally sufficient embeddings with
               semi-synthetic datasets and find that they improve causal
               estimation over related embedding methods. We illustrate the
               methods by answering the two motivating questions---the effect
               of a theorem on paper acceptance and the effect of a gender

              energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a
              high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires
              high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using
              magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse
              requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In
              this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for
              tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to
              command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets
              control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time
              satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach
              has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem
              specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to
              produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and

               two broad models of individual change. One approach theorizes
               people actively updating their beliefs and behaviors in the face
               of new information. The other argues that, following early
               socialization experiences, dispositions are stable. We formalize
               these two models, elaborate empirical implications of each, and
               derive a simple combined model for comparing them using panel
               data. We test this model on 183 attitude and behavior items from
               the 2006 to 2014 rotating panels of the General Social Survey.
               The pattern of results is complex but more consistent with the
               settled dispositions model than with the active updating model.
               Most of the observed change in the GSS appears to be short-term
               attitude change or measurement error rather than persisting
               changes. When persistent change occurs, it is somewhat more
               likely to occur in younger people and for public behaviors and
               beliefs about high-profile issues than for private attitudes. We

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The study of vaccine hesitancy identifies parental
              decisions to delay childhood vaccinations as an important public
              health issue, with consequences for immunization rates, the
              pursuit of nonmedical exemptions in states, and disease
              outbreaks. While prior work has explored the demographic and
              social underpinnings of parental decisions to delay childhood
              vaccinations, little is known about how the psychological
              dispositions of parents are associated with this choice. We
              analyze public opinion data to assess the role of psychological
              factors in reported parental decisions to delay childhood
              vaccination. RATIONALE: We anticipate that parents with certain
              psychological characteristics will be more likely to delay
              childhood vaccination. Specifically, we explore the roles of
              conspiratorial thinking, dispositions towards needle sensitivity,
              and moral purity; expecting that parents with high levels of any
              of these characteristics will be more likely to delay vaccinating
              their children. METHOD: In an original survey of 4010 American
              parents weighted to population benchmarks, we asked parents about
              delay-related vaccination behavior, demographic questions, and
              several psychological batteries. We then developed a vaccination
              delay scale and modeled delay as a function of conspiratorial
              thinking, needle sensitivity, moral purity, and relevant
              demographic controls. We then re-specified our models to look
              specifically at the predictors of delaying HPV vaccination, which
              has a low uptake rate in the United States. RESULTS: Controlling
              for other common predictors of hesitant behavior, we find that
              parents with high levels of conspiratorial thinking and needle
              sensitivity are more likely to report pursuing alternative
              vaccination schedules. When analyzing the specific decision by
              parents to delay HPV vaccination, we find that tendencies towards
              moral purity and, in turn, sexual deviance are also associated
              with vaccine seeking behavior. CONCLUSION: Parental decisions to
              delay childhood vaccinations are an important public health
              concern that are associated with conspiratorial thinking and
              needle sensitivity.",

              companies have avoided the trap of one-dimensional strategic
              responses-stick to your knitting, stick to the big markets. But
              many of them have fallen into a second, structural trap and
              adopted elaborate organizational matrices that actually impair
              their ability to implement sophisticated strategies. Keeping a
              company light on its feet strategically while still coordinating
              its activities across divisions, functions, even continents,
              means eliminating parochialism, improving communications, and
              weaving the decision-making process into the company's social
              fabric. Altering formal structure from the top down is a poor way
              to achieve these goals. It is easier to work from the bottom up,
              focusing on the attitudes and behavior of individual managers.
              The companies that have made best use of this focus-among them
              NEC, Philips, and Unilever-employ three techniques to capture the
              capabilities and commitment of each manager: 1. They communicate

               psychology, Jonathan Haidt shows how moral judgments arise not
               from reason but from gut feelings. He shows why liberals,
               conservatives, and libertarians have such different intuitions
               about right and wrong, and he shows why each side is actually
               right about many of its central concerns.In this subtle yet
               accessible book, Haidt gives you the key to understanding the
               miracle of human cooperation, as well as the curse of our
               eternal divisions and conflicts. If you're ready to trade in
               anger for understanding, read The Righteous Mind.",

               experienced users and newcomers alike This unique guide to
               Markov chains approaches the subject along the four convergent
               lines of mathematics, implementation, simulation, and
               experimentation. It introduces readers to the art of stochastic
               modeling, shows how to design computer implementations, and
               provides extensive worked examples with case studies. Markov
               Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation begins
               with a general introduction to the history of probability theory
               in which the author uses quantifiable examples to illustrate how
               probability theory arrived at the concept of discrete-time and
               the Markov model from experiments involving independent
               variables. An introduction to simple stochastic matrices and
               transition probabilities is followed by a simulation of a
               two-state Markov chain. The notion of steady state is explored
               in connection with the long-run distribution behavior of the
               Markov chain. Predictions based on Markov chains with more than
               two states are examined, followed by a discussion of the notion
               of absorbing Markov chains. Also covered in detail are topics
               relating to the average time spent in a state, various chain
               configurations, and n-state Markov chain simulations used for
               verifying experiments involving various diagram configurations.
               • Fascinating historical notes shed light on the key ideas that
               led to the development of the Markov model and its variants •
               Various configurations of Markov Chains and their limitations
               are explored at length • Numerous examples---from basic to
               complex---are presented in a comparative manner using a variety
               of color graphics • All algorithms presented can be analyzed in
               either Visual Basic, Java Script, or PHP • Designed to be useful

              attitudes, and policy opinions about COVID-19 in the earliest
              weeks of the national health crisis (March 20-23, 2020). METHOD:
              We designed and fielded an original representative survey of
              3,000 American adults between March 20-23, 2020 to collect data
              on a battery of 38 health-related behaviors, government policy
              preferences on COVID-19 response and worries about the pandemic.
              We test for partisan differences COVID-19 related policy
              attitudes and behaviors, measured in three different ways: party
              affiliation, intended 2020 Presidential vote, and self-placed
              ideological positioning. Our multivariate approach adjusts for a
              wide range of individual demographic and geographic
              characteristics that might confound the relationship between
              partisanship and health behaviors, attitudes, and preferences.
              RESULTS: We find that partisanship-measured as party
              identification, support for President Trump, or left-right
              ideological positioning-explains differences in Americans across
              a wide range of health behaviors and policy preferences. We find
              no consistent evidence that controlling for individual news
              consumption, the local policy environment, and local
              pandemic-related deaths erases the observed partisan differences
              in health behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes. In further analyses,
              we use a LASSO regression approach to select predictors, and find
              that a partisanship indicator is the most commonly selected
              predictor across the 38 dependent variables that we study.
              CONCLUSION: Our analysis of individual self-reported behavior,
              attitudes, and policy preferences in response to COVID-19 reveals
              that partisanship played a central role in shaping individual
              responses in the earliest months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These
              results indicate that partisan differences in responding to a

               short-running panel data. This work has concluded that lasting
               change in personal culture is rare after formative early years.
               This conclusion conflicts with a growing body of evidence for
               changes in personal culture after significant life course
               transitions, drawing on long-running panel data. To integrate
               these conflicting findings, the current study develops and
               applies a life course adaption model of personal culture,
               accounting for early imprinting and the continued possibility
               for change. Drawing on rich data from six long-running panel
               studies from five countries (BHPS, HILDA, PSID, SHP, SOEP,

               strong support for the proposition that individuals change
               persistently in their personal culture as they move through the
               life course. These changes are partly dependent on prior
               biographical experiences. Finally, personal culture fluctuates

                   intervention for identifying neuron activations that are
                   decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a
                   distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules
                   that mediate factual predictions while processing subject

                   correspond to factual association recall, we modify
                   feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations
                   using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). We find that ROME is

               argues that this powerful, novel technique permits the social
               sciences to meet a fundamentally new standard of explanation, in
               which one ``grows'' the phenomenon of interest in an artificial
               society of interacting agents: heterogeneous, boundedly rational
               actors, represented as mathematical or software objects. After
               elaborating this notion of generative explanation in a pair of
               overarching foundational chapters, Epstein illustrates it with
               examples chosen from such far-flung fields as archaeology, civil
               conflict, the evolution of norms, epidemiology, retirement
               economics, spatial games, and organizational adaptation. In

               Translator Stephen Kalberg is an internationally acclaimed

               arguments. Weber's original italicization, highlighting major
               themes, has been restored, and Kalberg has standardized Weber's
               terminology to better facilitate understanding of the various
               twists and turns in his complex lines of reasoning.Weber's
               compelling work remains influential for these reasons: it
               explores the continuing debate regarding the origins and legacy
               of modem capitalism in the West; it helps the reader understand
